            <p>Hi! I am Keith Geralde. I am currently studying in the University of the Philippines - Los Baños, 
                taking up my Bachelor’s in Statistics, with an elective track in Computer Science. I graduated 
                from Philippine Science High School - Central Visayas Campus with an elective track in Physics, 
                Computer Science, and Design and Make. I enjoy playing open-world games, watching anime, and 
                going to the gym. It has always been my passion to pursue a career path and contribute to the 
                growing field in Data Science especially here in the Philippines. My academic journey (or in 
                life in general) has taught me a lot of things; It taught me how to face tough situations and 
                how to overcome them. May my desires be ruled by reason and contribute for the betterment of the 
                Filipino community.</p>
